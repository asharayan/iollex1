        At [iollex], we’re passionate about simplifying complex programming concepts, and algorithms are at the heart of what we do. Algorithms are essentially problem-solving tools – structured sets of instructions designed to tackle tasks efficiently, no matter how large or small. From sorting data to finding the shortest path in a network, algorithms power the technology we interact with every <br /></p>
